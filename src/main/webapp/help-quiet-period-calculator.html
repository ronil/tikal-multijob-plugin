    <p>
        Enter a Groovy snipped that calculates a quiet period for a sub-job by it's index. The index is available
        as a variable named <i>index</i>. The resulting number is set as the quiet period in seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples:
    <ul>
        <li><code>0</code>: no quiet period for all sub-jobs</li>
        <li><code>index &lt; 5 ? 0 : 2 * 60</code>: start 4 jobs immediately, the other ones with a quiet time of 2
            minutes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
